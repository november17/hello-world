##doin stuff with javascript, php, and python.

Mostly here to cherry pick or snip bits of other people's coding that are way better at it than me and mash stuff together. Nothing fancy, sometimes I get ideas in my head and try to make them work :D

APIs are Fun. AI is interesting. Automation is fantastic, mostly because I'm really lazy. I spend a lot of time debugging.

I like beaches, [beer](http://www.n0v.pw/search/label/beer), and pizza.
