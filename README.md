##doin stuff with javascript, php, and python.

Mostly here to cherry pick other people's stuff that are way better coders than me to mash together. Nothing fancy, sometimes I get ideas in my head and try to make them work :D

APIs are Fun. AI is interesting. Automation is fantastic, mostly because I'm really lazy. I spend a lot of time debugging.

I like beaches, beer, and pizza.
